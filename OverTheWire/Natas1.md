## Step 1: Recon / Information Gathering

This challenge is similar to the last one. But wait...no. NO! Right click has been...blocked?! What will we do now?

## Step 2: Exploit / Solution

I'm not sure how to approach this. My most important tool, my mouse, has been taken from me. Everyone knows a hacker is useless with only a keyboard! Okay, whatever. Can I at least press F12? Will that even work?

Yes, apparently I can.

## Step 3: Lessons Learned
- Client-side restrictions (like disabling right-click) cannot enforce security; users can still access the underlying data through the browser or developer tools.
