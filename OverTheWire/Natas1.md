## Step 2: Exploit / Solution

I'm not sure how to approach this. My most important tool, my mouse, has been taken from me. Everyone knows a hacker is useless with only a keyboard! Okay, whatever. Can I at least press F12? Will that even work?

Yes, apparently I can.

## Step 3: Lessons Learned
- Seriously, don't keep secrets in your source code.  
- There are many ways to slice an onion. If the source code is accessible, then even a shocking amount of information can be gleaned.
