## Step 2: Exploit / Solution

	There isn't anywhere obvious to interact on this screen. This is also an introductory challenge, so I imagine the answer is somewhere *close*.
	What happens if we view the source code? Any hints or tips of where to look next?

	Well, that was a bit easier than expected. With the password in hand, onto the next level!

## Step 3: Lessons Learned
- Be careful what secrets are kept in source code. Better yet, don't keep secrets in your source code.
