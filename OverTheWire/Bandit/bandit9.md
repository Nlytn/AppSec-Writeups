# :trident: “Finding the Signal in the Static: Bandit9 and the Power of Uniq"

## :aerial_tramway: TL:DR

For Bandit 9's challenge, we have to find the one and only unique line within potentially millions. Leveraging `sort` with `uniq` makes simple - and scalable.

## :dart: Objective

Imagine, if you will, that you walk into work one bright, sunny morning and are given a daunting task. You are informed your company's web server logs have ballooned overnight - millions of entries and something is not quite right. You must now figure out which IP made *only one request* while every other IP made thousands. There is potential this is an attacker quietly testing the waters before launching something bigger.

### :one: Exploring the Environment  
It's another day that brings with it a new challenge. Though let's be honest: these are the challenges that make us smile. Let's log in and see what we can see:  

```bash
ls -la
```

![ls -la showing no obvious files](/Assets/bandit9_ls.png)
|:--:|
| * Listing of home directory contents * |

Alright, so we have one whole file: data.txt. Let's try to see what we can do with this file, if anything.  


## :two: Printing Contents of File

While it's possible the file we need is elsewhere on the system, we might as well take a look at the only entry in our current directory. Something tells me it's going to be a bit trickier than just opening and parsing this text file, but let's open it up for kicks and see what we are dealing with here:

Use 
```bash
cat data.txt
```

| ![find output before filtering stderr](/Assets/bandit9_cat.png) |
|:--:|
| * Output of ridiculous cat output * |


That's what I'm talking about! Now this is a challenge! If I'm being honest, I was going to be really bummed if I was presented with something like ten lines. 

## :three: Work Smart - Searching the file

So let's crack our knuckles and start going through this file. Who doesn't want to spend hours searching for the unique line, mixed in with duplicates, that could easily be overlooked?

Better yet, we could leverage another command line tool to do the work for us: `sort`. I can appreciate the "on the nose" naming convention Linux tends to employ. This tool does exactly what it says: it sorts the output and groups duplicates together. Let's try this out and see how this works:

```bash
sort data.txt
```

| ![output of sort](/Assets/Bandit9_sort.png) |
|:--:|
| * Output of `sort` command * |

That really didn't help as much as I hoped. It's about equivalent to just `cat`ing the file. We need to pipe this output to another command that will pull the unique line(s) from the file. This is where `uniq` comes into play. We are going to take the output from `sort` and send it to `uniq`. Then, and only then, will the *unique* output be returned to us. `uniq` works by checking the adjacent lines for duplicates and removing any found, therefore the file must be `sort`ed prior to running `uniq`. 

```bash
sort data.txt | uniq -u
```

* sort - sorts lines of text files. 

* data.txt - text file to be sorted

* | - pipe operand; send output from first command to second command for further processing

* `uniq -u` - compare adjacent lines and remove duplicates

## :brain: Understanding the Technique

This is a powerful technique that can be leveraged in a number of scenarios. This is not limited to text files; if you have a command that is outputting information which you need to sort, you can leverage `sort` and `uniq` to parse this data more effectively. This can save time and effort and further eliminate mistakes.

## :lock: Security Takeaway

In real-world environments, being able to rapidly parse massive logs or output files can be the difference between spotting a breach in time and missing it entirely. Tools like sort and uniq empower analysts to make sense of chaos efficiently.

```bash
ls -la
cat data.txt
sort data.txt
sort data.txt | uniq -u
```

## :writing_hand: Final Thoughts

This was another solid and meaningful challenge. I can absolutely imagine these tactics being leveraged not only in further challenges, but in everyday life in any position that leverages Linux. This task seemed to focus more on usability of the operating system and tools given than a specific security concept; knowing how to properly use one's toolset is equally beneficial to understanding the procedures within security at large.
